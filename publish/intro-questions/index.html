    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Amie Deng, Communication Design, Junior</li>
      <li>I have a minor in Computer Science, and I enjoy front-end web development and design.
          I took this class because it was a requirement for my degree.</li>
      <li>I have had experience with HTML/CSS/JS for about 2 years. I've learned web development
          through school and personal experience.</li>
      <li>I hope to learn more about designing and developing web pages from a designer's perspective.</li>
      <li>Designing for screens need to consider being responsive for web, mobile, tablet sizes.
          For paper, it typically involves singular, set dimensions.</li>
      <li>I think that the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/a/?af=43720035&c=.pi0.pk25650614176_308605552029_c_12026464216&sem_position=1t1&sem_target=kwd-12026464216&location_of_interest=&location_physical=9022867&ghost=true&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7JqFpvGl5AIV5__jBx1dKg4BEAAYASAAEgIVh_D_BwE">Airbnb</a>
          website implements effective design. There's a clear hierarchy and it's intuitive for the user. This design also prompts
          the user to scroll down.</li>
      <li>I really appreciate the <a href="https://showcase.withgoogle.com/demo/life-of-your-code">Google Cloud Showcase</a>
          because the site utilizes an engaging metaphor to communicate its content. The design of the site is also fairly
          minimal, so the illustrations and text are effectively emphasized and conveyed to the user.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> works well overall because it is clear and serves its purpose
          to the user. The site is also intuitive to navigate and displays its content well.</li>
    </ol>
