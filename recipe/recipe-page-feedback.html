  <h1>Recipe Page Feedback</h1>

  <h2>Feedback from Cheryl</h2>
  <p>There are some issues when the page is set to responsive.<br>
  Some spacing needs to be adjusted.<br>
  Wrong dash in 1st paragraph</p>

  <h2>Feedback from Erin</h2>
  <p>The first image is a little too big.<br>
  The first 2 large spacings is a lot.<br>
  Adjust the font size to account for the text rag.<br>
  The border radius should be more round or more square.</p>
