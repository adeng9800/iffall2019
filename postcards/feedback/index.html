  <h1>Feedback for Alec</h1>
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>Really good contrast with the text and image. I love the image choice and I really appreciate how the image choice focuses on the character.<br>
    The design relates to the concept because it looks like the characters are saying the quotes.</p>
  <h2>Suggestions</h2>
  <p>For the desktop size, maybe add more type variety such as changes in font size, font weight, and font style. Also, you could explore a neutral background color.<br>
    The image resolution for the 1st postcard is a bit grainy. <br>
    For the mobile size, maybe orient the quote to the direction the characters are facing so itâ€™s consistent with the desktop size or you could explore more central compositions.<br>
    There is an overlap of text and image on the 2nd postcard. You could also change the text color for the 2nd card as well.<br>
    Other possible suggestions could be to add overlays for the mobile size so you could add the text over the image without it competing.</p>
