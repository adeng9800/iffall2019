    <h1>Wireframe Feedback</h1>
    <h2>Feedback from Cheryl, Diana, and Erin</h2>

    <p>There are a lot of rounded edges in the imagery so I could round the icons.</p>
    <p>In my instruction paragraphs (2, 3, 7), there were orphans.</p>
    <p>In regards to white space, I have extreme rags with the text and uneven spacing between the images and text.</p>
    <p>I could have a different style for instruction numbers (can be larger).</p>
    <p>I need to make 1/2 and 1/4 numbers into the correct format.</p>
    <p>The arrow looks like a button, so make it clear itâ€™s for scrolling.</p>
